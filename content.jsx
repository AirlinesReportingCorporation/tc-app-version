          In 2020, many frequent travelers found themselves grounded far longer
          than they ever expected, due to the coronavirus pandemic. When
          travelers increasingly take to the skies again, how can they approach
          their travels more responsibly and sustainably? <br />
          <br />
          In this episode, Bruce Poon Tip, founder of G Adventures and author of
          Looptail: How One Company Changed the World by Reinventing Business
          and UNLEARN: The Year the Earth Stood Still, discusses his reflections
          on 2020 and how the travel industry can bounce back with a greater
          focus on sustainability and responsible travel.

          In 2019, ARC data showed a record number of passenger trips, and by

          2020 air travel came to an almost complete standstill, with new ticket
          purchases down more than 90% compared to 2019 levels. As we saw air

          proactive approach to help air travel the pandemic by launching the
          Fly Healthy, Fly Smart campaign. The Fly Healthy, Fly Smart campaign
          educates travelers on the enhanced cleaning and procedural changes
          U.S. airlines have implemented as well as raising awareness for the
